        | StochSS is open-source software. 
        | To obtain continued funding for sustained development,
        | we must show that StochSS is making an impact in the scientific community. 
        | For this, we need to know who is using the software, 
        | and a bit about what they are using it for. 
        | Please consider registering StochSS to show your support.

      | Welcome to StochSS! To get started, head over to the 
      | <a href="/hub/stochss/modeleditor" style="font-size: 20px;">Model Editor</a> 
      | and create new deterministic or well-mixed stochastic models for simulation. 
      | Or, if time is short, feel free to try out a model in the 
      | <a href="/publicLibrary" style="font-size:20px;">Example Library</a>. 
      | Once you have defined your model, go to the 
      | <a style="font-size: 20px;" href="/simulate">Simulation Manager</a> 
      | to perform your experiments, and then to the 
      | <a style="font-size: 20px;" href="/status">Status Page</a> 
      | to view the output.</p>
