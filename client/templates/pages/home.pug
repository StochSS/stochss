      | To get started, head over to the 
      | <a href="/hub/stochss/models" style="font-size: 17px;">File Browser</a> 
      | and create new deterministic or well-mixed stochastic models for simulation.

      | StochSS is open-source software. 
      | To obtain continued funding for sustained development,
      | we must show that StochSS is making an impact in the scientific community. 
      | For this, we need to know who is using the software, 
      | and a bit about what they are using it for. 
      | Please consider registering StochSS to show your support.
