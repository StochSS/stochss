      h2 Quickstart

      p Welcome to the Stochastic Simulation Service! In this tutorial we'll take you through the process of creating, simulating, and analyzing a model of a biochemical system.

      p We start our journey on the <a href="/stochss/models">file browser</a>. To start, let's make a new project folder where we can keep files. Right-click on the root folder and click New Directory on the list of options. Let’s name the directory Quickstart. Click on the new directory so it’s selected, then click the 'Actions for Quickstart' button at the bottom of the browser. Actions for a directory include renaming or duplicating the directory, as well as creating, uploading, or downloading files to the selected directory. You can also access these options by right-clicking on a directory in the StochSS file browser. For now, choose the Create Model option.

      h2 Creating a Model
      p From here you’re taken to the model editor. Since you're creating a new model you'll need to choose the default species "mode" for your model. StochSS supports deterministic ODE-based simulations (concentration) as well as discrete stochastic simulations (population). An exciting feature of StochSS is the ability to run "hybrid" simulations that utilize both deterministic and probabilistic algorithms during a simulation, thanks to the powerful <a href="https://gillespy2.github.io/GillesPy2/docs/build/html/index.html">GillesPy2</a> library. If you’re unsure of which to choose, go ahead and select “Population.”

      h3 Help and Information
      p As we begin creating the model, observe the blue <em>?</em> button by the "Model Editor" heading, and the many smaller blue <em>i</em> tooltips throughout the page. Because StochSS supports a wide variety of features, it includes numerous “tooltips” providing helpful information. Click on the large <em>?</em> icon at the top of the page for an overview of the page contents. Hovering over the blue <em>i</em> icons will provide more info on an item.

      h3 Adding Components to a Model
      p Proceeding with the model editor, let’s recreate the Degradation model that’s in the Examples folder. This model contains one species, one parameter, and one reaction to represent protein decay. To start, add a new species called “protein” with an initial condition of 50, and make a parameter called “decayrate” with a value of 0.05. At this point we’re ready to create a reaction to apply the “decayrate” parameter to our “protein” species. Since we are modeling decay we’ll select the A → ∅ reaction type.

      p Now we have a functional model of a biochemical system. Let’s run a quick preview to explore our model a bit. Click Run Preview at the bottom of the page to create a sample time series below the model editor.

      h3 Workflows

      p To run a full simulation and explore the results more thoroughly, you’ll need to create a StochSS Workflow. Click New Workflow at the bottom of the page to head to the Workflow Selection page. You can also create a new workflow from the browser window by right-clicking a Model (.mdl file) or selecting it and pressing the Actions for <Name> button. From here you’ll see several different options for exploring your model, but at the moment we’re interested in the Ensemble Simulation workflow.

      img.quickstart(style="width: 90%;", src="static/workflow-editor-ensemble-simulation.png")

      p From here you’ll choose a simulation algorithm and set configuration for your workflow. By default StochSS will choose a simulation style for you, but for this example let’s go with SSA (Stochastic Simulation Algorithm). In the “Stochastic Settings” section set trajectories to 10. This will create an “ensemble” of 10 different stochastic time series. Click the “Start Workflow” button when you’re ready. Your results should appear momentarily.

      img.quickstart(style="width: 90%;", src="static/workflow-results-std-deviation-plot.png")

      p Once your workflow is complete you can explore various graphs describing the simulation results, download the raw data, and download JSON files describing each graph that you can use with the <a href="https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/">Plotly</a> graphing library. You can also come back to your results later by accessing the .wkfl file in your quickstart project folder.
