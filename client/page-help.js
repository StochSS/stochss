        <b>Note</b>: Some files will open in a new tab so you may want to turn off the pop-up blocker.</p>
        <p><b>Open Directory</b>: Click on the arrow next to the directory or double-click on the directory.</p>
        <p><b>Create a Directory/Model</b>: Right-click on a directory, click New Directory/New Model, and enter the name of directory/model or path.  
        For models you will need to click on the type of model you wish to create before entering the name or path.</p>
        <p><b>Create a Workflow</b>: Right-click on a model and click New Workflow, this takes you to the workflow selection page.  
        From the workflow selection page, click on one of the listed workflows.</p>
        <p><b>Convert a File</b>: Right-click on a Model/SBML, click Convert, and click on the desired Convert to option.  
        Model files can be converted to Spatial Models, Notebooks, or SBML files.  
        Spatial Models and SBML file can be converted to Models.

        <p><b>Variale</b>: A variable refers to a pool of entities that are considered 
          indistinguishable from each other for the purposes of the model and may participate 
          in reactions.</p>
        <p><b>Parameter</b>: A Parameter is used to define a symbol associated with 
          a value; this symbol can then be used in mathematical formulas in a model.</p>
        <p><b>Reaction</b>: A reaction in SBML represents any kind of process that can change 
          the quantity of one or more variables in a model.  At least one variable is required to 
          add a reaction and at least one parameter is required to add a mass action reaction.</p>
        <p><b>Event</b>: Events describe the time and form of instantaneous, discontinuous state 
          changes in the model.  An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables 
          that are affected by it, how the variables are affected, and the eventâ€™s relationship 
          to other events.  At least one variable or parameter is required to add an event.</p>
        <p><b>Rule</b>: Rules provide additional ways to define the values of variables 
          in a model, their relationships, and the dynamical behaviors of those variables.  The 
          rule type Assignment Rule is used to express equations that set the values of variables.  
          The rule type Rate Rule is used to express equations that determine the rates of change 
          of variables.  At least one variable or parameter is required to add a rule.</p>
        <p><b>Preview</b>: A preview of the model shows the results of the first five seconds of a 
          single trajectory of the model simulation.  At least one variable and one reaction, event, 
          or rule is required to run a preview.</p>
        <p><b>Workflow</b>: A workflow allows you to run a full model with multiple trajectories with 
          settings the will help refine the simulation.  At least one variable and one reaction, event, 
          or rule is required to create a new workflow.</p>

        Workflow Names always end with a time stamp.</p>
        <p><b>Model Path</b>: If you move or rename the model make sure to update this path.</p>
        <p><b>Settings</b>: This is where you can customize the settings for your workflow.

        The settings are only available for workflows that have not been run.</p>
        <p><b>Status</b>: This section displays the status and start time of the Workflow.  If the workflow hasn't been sarted this section is closed.</p>
        <p><b>Results</b>: You may change the title, x-axis label, and y-axis label by clicking on the edit plot button then enter the name in the correct field.</p>
        <p><b>Info</b>: This section displays any warnings and/or error that are logged by the running workflow.</p>
        <p><b>Model</b>: This section lets you view the model that was used when you ran the workflow.</p>
