PyURDME Example: MinD Oscillations in E. coli
=============================================

Introduction
----------------------
One spatial reaction-diffusion system that has been studied frequently in the literature both in a deterministic setting (Huang et. al, 2003) and using a stochastic description (Fange and Elf, 2006) is describing the periodic oscillations of Min proteins in the bacterium E. Coli. By oscillating from pole to pole, MinC suppresses the formation of a cell division site at the poles, indirectly positioning it in the middle of the cell.
