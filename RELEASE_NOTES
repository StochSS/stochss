- Configuration of batch computing resources

1.8.0
=============================
- Parameter Sweep tool allow 1D/2D parameter sweeps for all models
- Integration of Jupyter Notebooks on job result pages for post-processing analysis
- Status page updates for filtering and automatic forwarding of running->finished jobs
- Added option to change tolerances for ODE simulation

1.7.0
=============================
- Volume rendering visualization for spatial jobs.
- StochSS-launcher uses docker containers to run StochSS. Includeds support for newest OSX and Windows operating systems.
- Added RSS feed and StochSS registration to front page

1.6.1
=============================
- Updated PyURDME to work with FEniCS 1.6

1.6.0
=============================
- Spatial visualization now supports animation, wireframe rendering, and mesh slicing 
- FlexCloud:  run ‘cloud’ jobs on dedicated hardware (in addition to using EC2)
- Import SBML models

1.5.1
=============================
- Bugfix release

1.5.0
=============================
- Launching VMs is done asynchronously
