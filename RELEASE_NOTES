StochSS - Stochastic Simulation Service: Release Notes

1.5.0
=============================
- Added job reproduction system for cloud. Data for cloud jobs can be deleted and then reproduced when needed
- Added cost analysis system. Cost analysis tests can be run to figure out the cost of running different jobs on different computers
- Model editor rebuilt to be more efficient

1.4.1
=============================
- Bugfix release

1.4.0
=============================
- Integration of PyURDME: Spatial stochastic simulation on complex
  geometries using tetrahedral meshes.  
- Advanced visualization of mesh geometries and spatial simulation
  results via WebGL.

1.3.0
=============================
- Added interface to StochOptim stochastic parameter estimation toolbox
- real-time visualization of parameter value convergence 

1.2.0
=============================
- Implement deterministic sensitivity analysis
- Import/Export of data for backup and recovery
- New login and user system (required login to use)
- Enhanced plotting

1.1.0
=============================
- Support for ODE-based simulations

- Updated StochKit version 2.0.10

1.0.3
=============================
- Support for OSX Mavericks
- Fixed bug that prevented proper termination of local StochKit2 processes

1.0.2
