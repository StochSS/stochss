StochSS - Stochastic Simulation Service: Release Notes

1.6.0
=============================
- Spatial visualization now supports animation, wireframe rendering, and mesh slicing 
- FlexCloud:  run ‘cloud’ jobs on dedicated hardware (in addition to using EC2)
- Import SBML models
- Many bug fixes and stability enhancements

1.5.1
=============================
- Bugfix release

1.5.0
=============================
- Launching VMs is done asynchronously
- Instance types can be configured for head and worker nodes
- Job reproduction system introduced for cloud. Data for cloud jobs can be deleted and then reproduced when needed
- Cost analysis system introduced for cloud. Cost analysis tests can be run to figure out the cost of running different jobs on different computers
- Model editor rebuilt to be more efficient

1.4.1
=============================
- Bugfix release

1.4.0
=============================
- Integration of PyURDME: Spatial stochastic simulation on complex
  geometries using tetrahedral meshes.  
- Advanced visualization of mesh geometries and spatial simulation
  results via WebGL.

1.3.0
=============================
- Added interface to StochOptim stochastic parameter estimation toolbox
- real-time visualization of parameter value convergence 

1.2.0
=============================
- Implement deterministic sensitivity analysis
- Import/Export of data for backup and recovery
- New login and user system (required login to use)
